Is it poisonous?
Im not risking it! We are moving out!
Please just dont fly üôè
OMG don't touch it!
NOPE. Not today!
Burn the house down!
Why is it looking at me?!?
That thing has wings???
I'm officially done.
Somebody call animal control!
If it moves, I'm moving out.
This is why I don't go outside.
Just pretend you didn't see it.
Are those fangs?!?
RUN. NOW.
That's not from this planet.
I need a flamethrower.
Back away slowly...
Tell my family I love them.
